# Proyecto-Inventario-Skyrim
A program inspired by the inventory of the famous game The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim, where I try to recreate the inventory using techniques such as object-oriented code and apply several functions, such as Sort for example. Where the user will be able to review the inventory according to the different categories of objects, save and delete objects, add and remove favorites and sort the inventory according to their convenience.
# The Programm
The program will display a menu where the user can interact to select what action they want to do, having six options:
1. Add Object
2. Remove Object
3. Sort Inventory
4. Add Favorite
5. Remove Favorite
6. Sort Inventory
